LANDING WEBPAGE. With all the projects and scope I mentioned here, I'd like to create a minimal landing webpage.

Current one is a bit mem... https://qutsur.com/, and is hosted in Framer. I want to host it in Framer + DonWeb.  I want to migrate to githubpages + custom domain (so i don't pay framer)
