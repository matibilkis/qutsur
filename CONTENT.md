## Section 1: What We Offer

### Section Title
**What We Do**
---

#### Training

**Headline:** Training the next generation of quantum practitioners

**Description:**  
We design and deliver training programs that translate quantum computing and quantum‑inspired methods into the language of engineers, data scientists, technical and bussiness leaders.  
From short workshops to longer-format programs, we help teams and organizations to build enough intuition to make informed decisions about when—and when not—to invest in quantum technologies.

**Example formats (non-exhaustive):**

- Executive briefings on the real state of quantum tech  
- Technical workshops for engineers and data scientists  
- Early-stage curriculum design for university and inter‑university programs in quantum software and applications

---

#### Monitoring & Strategic Insight

**Headline:** Clear signal in a noisy quantum landscape

**Description:**  
Quantum announcements move fast and are often over‑promised. We monitor research, industry moves, and standards to help organizations separate signal from noise.  
You get concise, decision‑ready insight on what is technically real, what is road‑map relevant, and how it might affect your strategy in the next 3–5 years.

**Typical questions we help with:**

- “Do we actually need a quantum roadmap now, or can we wait?”  
- “Which areas (optimization, sensing, security, materials) are most relevant to our sector?”  
- “How do we talk about quantum with our board, clients, or regulators?”

#### Ecosystem Building

**Headline:** Building quantum capacity where it’s most needed

**Description:**  
We work with universities, companies, research centers, and NGOs to create concrete structures—programs, residencies, working groups—that keep quantum talent connected to local contexts while plugged into global networks.  
Our focus is on practical, low‑friction initiatives that can survive political and funding cycles and slowly accumulate expertise, relationships, and opportunities.

**Examples of how we collaborate:**

- Co‑designing quantum‑themed residencies and innovation spaces  
- Helping physics and CS departments connect with industry partners  
- Supporting community events and working groups on quantum and AI

## Section 2: Who We Work With

### Section Title
**Who This Is For**

---

We collaborate with organizations that need clarity more than buzzwords:

- Companies exploring whether quantum should be on their 3–10 year roadmap  
- Universities and research centers structuring new quantum or quantum‑adjacent programs  
- Public institutions and NGOs thinking about technological sovereignty and talent retention  
- Funds, foundations, and ecosystem actors looking for grounded views on quantum opportunities

## Section 3: Who We Are

### Section Title
**About QutSur**

---

QutSur is led by Mati Bilkis, a physicist specialized in quantum machine learning, with experience building and leading quantum‑focused research lines in Europe and Latin America and collaborating with industry, now based in Argentina with a global network.  
Our work sits at the intersection of quantum technologies, machine learning, and real‑world applications, with a strong emphasis on emerging and underserved ecosystems.

We combine:

- Deep technical background in quantum algorithms, sensing, and quantum‑inspired machine learning  
- Experience working with companies and public‑private partners on applied projects  
- A long‑term commitment to creating viable quantum careers and initiatives beyond a single startup or grant cycle
